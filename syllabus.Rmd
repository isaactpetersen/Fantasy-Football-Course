# Prerequisites {#prereqs}

The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences has a hierarchical course structure that requires students to complete certain prerequisite courses before taking upper-level courses.
This course requires successful completion (C- or higher) of any of the following statistics courses (or AP Statistics from high school):
PSY 2811, PSQF 1020, PSQF 4143, STAT 1010, STAT 1015, STAT 1020, STAT 1030, STAT 3510, STAT 4143
The department will check student records to ensure completion of course prerequisites.

Any of the following courses with a minimum grade of C- (or AP stats from high school):
PSY 2811, PSQF 1020, PSQF 4143, STAT 1010, STAT 1015, STAT 1020, STAT 1030, STAT 3510, STAT 4143

# Description of Course {#description}

How can we use information to make predictions about uncertain events?
This course is about empiricism (basing theories on observed data) and judgment, prediction, and decision making in the context of uncertainty.
Students will be introduced to modern analytical techniques used to make informed predictions, test theories, and draw conclusions from a given dataset.
But this is no ordinary course...

Rather than memorizing these empirical approaches in abstraction, students will employ these methods in the active, immersive, hands-on learning laboratory of Fantasy Football.
In this way, the course will weave together two contiguous threads: an introductory overview of data analysis techniques, and a captivating application of these techniques through a semester-long experience in Fantasy Football with their classmates.[^adapted]

The class involves reading primary source material, applying statistical programming (using `R` software), conducting data analysis, and composing written work on a weekly basis.

The class does not assume that students know anything about (or care about) football or fantasy football.
The class is welcome to all, assuming the student meets the prerequisites and that they are interested in learning about empiricism (basing theories on observed data), statistics, and judgment, prediction, and decision making in the context of uncertainty.

Take this class if:

- you want to learn more advanced skills in 1) empiricism, 2) statistics, 3) programming (using `R` software), and 4) judgment, prediction, and decision making in the context of uncertainty;
- you are interested in learning statistics through the lens of a fun sports domain (fantasy football); or
- you are interested in applying psychological and statistical concepts to fantasy football; to gain a strong understanding of critical thinking and decision making in sports.

*You are urged to reconsider your decision to take this class if*:

- you are just looking for an "easy" class (the class is not easy);
- you are reluctant to examine fantasy football topics in a scientific manner; or
- you do not want to learn statistics and programming, and do not want to persist through inevitable challenges along the way.

## What is Fantasy Football? And Why Focus on Fantasy Football? {#fantasyFootball}

Fantasy football is an online game where participants assemble (i.e., "draft") imaginary teams composed of real-life National Football League (NFL) players.
In the game of fantasy football, participants compete against others, accumulating "fantasy" points based on players' actual statistical performances in games (and the goal is to outscore one’s opponent each week to win matches and ultimately claim victory in the league).
Fantasy football relies heavily on prediction—trying to predict which players will perform best and selecting them accordingly.
In this way, fantasy football provides a plethora of decision making opportunities in the face of uncertainty, and a wealth of data for analyzing these decisions.
However, unlike many other applied domains in psychology, fantasy football (1) allows a person to see the accuracy of their predictions on a timely basis and (2) provides a safe environment for friendly competition.
Thus, it provides a unique domain to evaluate—and improve—the accuracy of various prediction models.

# Learning Objectives {#objectives}

By the end of the course, successful students will be able to:

- Apply empirical inference and appreciate the value it provides over speculative supposition.
- Ask educated questions when confronted with decisions in the face of uncertainty.
- Understand human decision making, including common heuristics and cognitive biases and how to mitigate them analytically.
- Engage in critical thinking about causality, including devising plausible alternative explanations for observed effects.
- Understand causal inference including confounding, causal pathways, and counterfactuals.
- Think empirically about human behavior and performance.
- Describe the strengths and weaknesses of humans versus computers in prediction scenarios.
- Apply basic skills in statistical programming using `R` to manipulate and summarize datasets and to conduct data analysis.
- Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of different statistical models and methodologies used in predicting uncertain events, enhancing their understanding of statistical inference and model selection.
- Use various analytical techniques for predicting the outcome of uncertain events, and for uncovering latent causes of patterns in observed data.
- Interpret findings from various statistical approaches and evaluate the accuracy of predictions.
- Engage in iterative problem-solving processes, refining analytical approaches based on feedback and outcomes, and adapting strategies accordingly.
- Communicate statistical findings and analyses in both written and oral formats, demonstrating proficiency in presenting complex information to diverse audiences.
- Make sense of big data.
- Use practical analytical skills that can be applied in future research and job settings.

# Textbook {#textbook}

The cost of textbooks has become so high that I do not feel comfortable requiring students to purchase a textbook.
Thus, I created a textbook for this course.
The textbook for this course is available <u>for free</u> online:

# Academic Honesty and Misconduct {#academicHonesty}

All students in CLAS courses are expected to abide by the [CLAS Code of Academic Honesty](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
Academic misconduct must be reported by instructors to CLAS according to [these procedures](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
Please note that collaboration with other classmates on <u>INSERT</u> is not permitted.
However, I do encourage you to collaborate with classmates on <u>INSERT</u>.
Because writing, analytical, and critical thinking skills are part of the learning outcomes of this course, all work submitted by students should be prepared by the student.
Developing strong competencies in these domains will prepare you for a competitive workplace.Therefore, AI-generated submissions are not permitted and will be treated as plagiarism.

### Missing Exams {#missingExams}

Students are allowed to make up exams that have been missed due to illness, mandatory religious observations, official University activities, or other unavoidable circumstances.
Note: the format of the make-up exam may differ from the original exam.
If you know that you must be away at the time of an exam for one of these reasons, Professor Petersen <u>or the TA</u> must be contacted in advance whenever possible to schedule a make-up exam.
In order to take a make-up exam, you must provide acceptable documentation to be eligible to take it: including documentation for any report of illness; any other circumstances must be documented by the University of Iowa [Absence Explanation Form](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/student-attendance-and-absences) and must be approved by Professor Petersen.
<u>In sum, to be eligible for a make-up exam, Professor Petersen <u>or the TA</u> must be contacted before the examination whenever possible, and you must send acceptable form of documentation to Professor Petersen <u>or the TA</u></u>.

"*This material probably won't win you fantasy football championships.
You could take what we learn and apply it to fantasy football and you might become 5 percent more likely to win.
Or...
Consider the broader relevance of this.
You could learn data analysis and figure out ways to apply it to other systems.
And you could be making a six-figure salary within the next five years.*"
